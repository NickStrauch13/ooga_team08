Our selected game is Pac-Man. The three game variants are:
  * Anti-Pacman
    * Instead of controlling the yellow Pac-Man, the user instead controls the ghosts. This is a
    complete 180 from normal Pac-Man as the user's objectives have been flipped.
  * Mrs.Pacman
    * The game textures are changed to a new style.
  * Pacman Extreme
    * Normal Pacman but there are additional power-ups scattered around the board. These may
    include perks like speed boosts, double points, fewer ghosts, and more.
