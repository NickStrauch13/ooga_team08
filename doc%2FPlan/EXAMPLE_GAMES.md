###EXAMPLE GAMES

##Game Type 1

Our first game type that we will implement is classic Pacman. This version aligns with the funcitonality of normal Pacman. This includes navigating a grid with energy dots, avoiding ghosts, levels that progress in difficulty, and pickups (cherry, big dot that makes ghosts edible etc.).

##Game Type 2

Our second game type will be anti-Pacman. In anti-Pacman you play as the ghost (only one) and you chase the Pacman which tries to avoid you. This introduces a difficult design problem because both the ghost and the pacman have to be play by the usable and controllable by the computer.

##Game Type 3

Our third game type will be powered up Pacman. This will introduce many more pickups that the user can collect that give Pacman special abilities. Potentially, these will allow the Pacman to move through walls, move faster, and shoot the ghosts.

##Last Game Type

There will also be a mrs Pacman mode which just adjusts how the Pacman is display. It may simply add a bow to Pacman's character.
